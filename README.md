# Video-Object-Tracking-with-network-architecture-for-video-object-tracking-with-GoTurn-Architecture
The project was based on the work of [nrupatunga/goturn-pytorch](https://github.com/nrupatunga/goturn-pytorch/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file).
In this project, you can find two files : 
- One file for preprocessing the data and converting segmentation masks into bounding boxes.
- One file for compunting the results.
This work was made by Skander MAHJOUB, Paul FOUILHAC and Eliot WALTER
